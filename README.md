Hi, I’m Hellen Tian, a PhD candidate in the Department of Sociology at the University of Oregon. My research lies at the intersection of cultural and environmental sociology. I study the formation of classification systems and how they shape economic and environmental outcomes, particularly how ideas about nature, authenticity, and value become stabilized and institutionalized over time. Methodologically, I combine computational text analysis with historical research. My current research uses the case of wine to study how systems of classification shape environmental value, development, and inequality from colonial France to contemporary global markets.
